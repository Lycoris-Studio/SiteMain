## Nightwatch
![Nightwatch](/Nightwatch.png "Nightwatch")

The fourth gamejam release by Lycoris Studio, with a gamejam theme of "Pay Attention", we decided to create Nightwatch, a horror-esque game where you play as a run-of-the-mill prison guard named Doug. Unfortunately for Doug, the prison has been infiltrated by a monster. Your boss, being the uncompromising push about he's always been, has ordered you to still come into work like usual. 

Now, instead of evacuating the prisoners to safety (arguably the more rational thing to do), you must ensure they stay safe by keeping an eye on them at all times, all the while still completing your other office duties, like signing papers and taking out the trash.

You can play Nightwatch here:
